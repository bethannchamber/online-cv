career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am actively looking for positions related to research and data analysis in industry or academia in the Greater Copenhagen area. If remote work is supported by the company (now, but also in post-pandemic times), then I am open to any position in Europe or the US. 
      
      Ideally, I hope to develop my data analysis and/or research skills by assisting with quantitative and/or qualitative research regardless of the topic. Depending on the project scope and the skills required, I would also be interested in independently leading the research process with the design (survey, interview schedule, etc), data collection (online, telephone, face-to-face), analysis, and finally the presentation (summary/visualization). 
      
      Presently, I am independently developing new skills that will assist with future data analysis tasks including: Python, SQL, and Power BI. I'm familiar with Git, Anaconda/Conda, and Jupyter Notebook. I consider myself to be a quick learner and easily adaptable, so if the position requires learning of any particular programming language or software, I would enjoy - and rise to! - the challenge.
